This is an intermediate applied statistics unit addressing the collection (design of experiments), exploration, summarisation, analysis and reporting of continuous data. You will analyse data using general linear models and communicate findings using oral and written methods. You will use mathematical and statistical software, such as R, to enhance your data analysis and develop your statistical programming skills.
